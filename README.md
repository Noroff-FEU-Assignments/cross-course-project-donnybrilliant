[Rainydays](https://daniel-vier-cross-course-project.netlify.app/) is a fictional website/store I created for the cross-course-project at Noroff.

## Description

This is a project built through two semesters at Noroff.
We started out designing it in Adobe XD/Figma, focusing on UI/UX, then we created it with HTML & CSS, added JavaScript and then fetch the products from my Wordpress/Woocommerce API. Making it a headless CMS.

It is the only yellow raincoat you'll ever need.
